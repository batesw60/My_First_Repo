1. Clone the project repo onto your computer and use the `cd` (change directory) command to get into it.

2. Run the following command in your terminal to create and checkout to a new branch:

  `git checkout -b new-branch`

3. You should now be on a new branch named "new-branch." In order to verify that this worked, run the following command in your terminal:

  `git branch`

4. You should see two branches listed: `main` and `new-branch`. The `new-branch` branch should have an asterisk to the left of it. This indicates that this is the branch you're currently on.
